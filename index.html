      Long has there been a wall between schools but no more.
      I intend to bridge the gap between us so we can communicate freely.
      This site may not be much yet as It was created in around 50 minutes.
      currently a shoutbox has been provided in order to allow communication between the schools.
      if you are from Mundelien please insert -M at the end of your name.
      if you are from Stevenson please add -S to the end of your name.
      aside from that feel free to use whatever username you see fit.
      I intend to add a deep leveled forum like part to this site soon and is already in the works.
      Development may be slow as I am but a single highschool student and am the entire DEV team.
      Please feel free to share this site.
