    Long has there been a wall between schools but no more.\nI intend to bridge the gap between us so we can communicate freely.\nThis site may not be much yet as It was created in around 50 minutes.\n currently a shoutbox has been provided in order to allow communication between the schools.\nif you are from Mundelien please insert -M at the end of your name\nif you are from Stevenson please add -S to the end of your name\naside from that feel free to use whatever username you see fit.\nI intend to add a deep leveled forum like part to this site soon and is already in the works.\nDevelopment may be slow as I am but a single highschool student and am the entire DEV team.\nPlease feel free to share this site.
